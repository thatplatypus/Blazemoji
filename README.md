## Overview
Blazemoji is a modern web application designed specifically for emojicode. It's about time we start building a great editor for a great language. The project is still in early stages so all feedback and feature requests are welcome. 

Features include:
- Compile and run emojicode right in the browser!
- Light / Dark theme built in
- Emojicode quick reference toolbox
- Code editor keybindings for common emojis like `shift`+`"` turns into `🔤`
- Library of sample scripts with support for saving scripts in local storage
- More coming soon
  - Researching syntax highlighting in monaco for ☁️ and 🔤

## Prerequisites
- .NET 10 SDK
- Docker, for anything that compiles or runs Emojicode

Emojicode's only usable release (1.0 beta 2) ships x86_64 Linux binaries, so the compiler runs in a `linux/amd64` container. On Apple Silicon, Docker Desktop emulates it.

## Run the app

```bash
docker build -f Blazemoji/Dockerfile -t blazemoji .
docker run --rm -p 5080:8080 blazemoji
```

Then open http://localhost:5080.

`dotnet run --project Blazemoji` also starts the app and is fine for working on the UI, but Run Code only works where the bundled compiler can execute: x86_64 Linux with `g++` and `libtinfo5` installed.

## Running Tests

```bash
docker build -f Blazemoji/Dockerfile --target test .
```

This builds the solution and runs every test, including the ones that compile and run the samples with the real compiler.

```bash
dotnet test --solution Blazemoji.sln
```

runs the same tests on your machine. The compiler tests skip themselves anywhere other than x86_64 Linux.

## Emojicode
See the official [docs](https://www.emojicode.org/docs/) for more information on emojicode. The [language reference](https://www.emojicode.org/docs/reference/) will be very handy for writing emojicode.
