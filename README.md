## Overview

## Installation & Build
Clone the repo and run 

```csharp
dotnet buildd
```

### Prerquisites
- dotnet 7 installed
- C# installed
- Visual Studio installed, recommended 2022+
- [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed, windows only
- Ubuntu 18.04 or later if WSL
- C++ compiler and linker, such as `clang++` or `g++` 

## Setup & Configuration
Blazemoji depends on being launched in a host environment that can execute the `emojicodec` compiler. Blazor can be launched in a WSL environment targetting Linux from Windows, so this is what we'll need to do in order to compile and run the emojicode correctly. To run everything correctly in WSL, you will have to go through the WSL setup and install steps.

## Running Tests
```csharp
dotnet test
```

## Emojicode
See the official [docs](https://www.emojicode.org/docs/) for more information on emojicode. The [language reference](https://www.emojicode.org/docs/reference/) will be very handy for writing emojicode.
